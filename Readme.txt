*Thought Process and Design Decisions
- I thought of changing all the graphics on the site
- I browsed for images and jpegs that suit the color scheme.

*Improvement and Additional features
- I consider modifying the textual information on the website to suit the purpose for which it serve i.e logisitics
- Naming the site a popular logisitic nomenclature i.e Maersk.
- I improved the services section
- I improved the about-section and modified the textual information
- I deem it fit to retain the FAQ and the testimonial section as they both add to development of a logistics website
